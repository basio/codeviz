CodeViz - Code Visualizer (based off of OnlinePythonTutor - www.pythontutor.com)

Abstract: 
  In this thesis we look at the visualization of data structures derived from a programâ€™s exe- cution context at each execution step, by which we aim to demonstrate that this approach is effective in facilitating the understanding and debugging of code. The first step being to pro- vide a default generated visualization of the underlying data structure, which can be viewed as a sequence of snapshots alongside the code. We then look at the customization of this visualization to facilitate a more concise understanding of the underlying conceptual-model with the idea of reducing the gulf of evaluation when looking at new or forgotten code. This customized view can then also provide a mechanism for aiding in debugging, thereby reduc- ing the gulf of execution. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through a case study.
